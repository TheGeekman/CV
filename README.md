# Paul Fitzgerald

I am a full stack web-developer with 5 years professional experience in the tech industry, having worked for both Microsoft and Skype. 

I recently completed a 12-week, highly-selective web-development course at London's Maker's Academy, following which I strive to write clear, concise and modular code. 

Please see [my personal website](http://www.paulfitz.co.uk/) for details of some of the projects I have worked on during my time at Maker's Academy. 

My [Github profile](https://github.com/Pau1fitz), contains examples of code that I have written and my [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4425849/paul-fitzgerald) account demonstrates how I have been contributing to the developer community by asking and answering questions.
